## Introduction

Welcome to the Salifort Motors Capstone Project. This project aims to analyze and model the employee data from Salifort Motors to understand factors affecting employee turnover and other related metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle].

### Description

- `left`: Indicates whether the employee has left (1) or stayed (0).
- `department`: The department where the employee works.
- `average_monthly_hours`: The average number of hours the employee works per month.
- `number_project`: The number of projects the employee is involved in.
- `tenure`: The number of years the employee has been with the company.

## Features 

- **Data Cleaning**: Processes to handle missing values and data inconsistencies.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes Seaborn and Matplotlib for insightful visualizations.
- **Modeling**: Implements various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and XGBoost.
- **Evaluation**: Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

### Data Visualization

Visualizations include:

1. Distribution of employees who left versus those who stayed.
